# Simuladtion of QPSK Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum Communication System
*Final Project of Digital Communication Systems Course. by Dr. Ahmadian*

**July 2020**

In this project we are assuming that a ***single user*** wants to transmit an arbitrary bitstream through an ***AWGN Channel*** using ***QPSK*** modulation and ***CDMA*** technique as multiple access scheme.

Also at the receiver, we have ***Coherent Correlation Detector***.

I recommend reading [report](/Report.pdf) file in the project for more detail and instructions.

## Components:
- Polar NRZ Line Coding function
- Serial to Parallel function
- PN Sequence generator function
- Correlation Detector
- Parallel to Serial function

## Plots:
- I and Q plots in time-domain
- I and Q spectrum
- Constellation diagram ( both TX and RX )
